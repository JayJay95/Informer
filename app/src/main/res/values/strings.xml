    <string name="ballotmarking_message1">Once my details are confirmed on the register, I am issued with ballot papers to cast my vote.
The Polling Clerk gives me the ballot papers, I look at the ballot paper keenly to ensure that it bears IEBC validating rubber stamp. If the ballot paper is not rubber stamped, my vote will be rejected.</string>

    <string name="ballotmarking_message2">I take my ballot paper inside the voting screen so that no one can see whom I am voting for. There is a pen there for me to use.
I open the ballot to see the names of all the candidates. I find the name of the candidate I want.
I make an X in the space beside the name of the candidate I choose. The X is my vote. If I make a mistake, I can take my ballot back and ask for another one.</string>


    <string name="ballotmarking_message3">I fold my ballot to keep my vote a secret and cast it in the ballot box. I am keen to ensure that I place the ballot paper in a ballot box with corresponding/ similar colour.
Then I go to the polling clerk who will mark my left small finger with indelible ink. I have just voted! I collect my ID/Passport and leave the polling station.</string>
